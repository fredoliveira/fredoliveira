### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am Fred Oliveira, a software engineer by trade, and currently the CTO at [Union](https://union.vc). Before Union, I was the Director of Engineering at [1776](https://1776.vc), and before _that_, I ran a product consultancy called [Webreakstuff](https://webreakstuff.com). A lifetime ago I was the first employee at [Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com). You can find me on [https://twitter.com/f](Twitter as @f).
