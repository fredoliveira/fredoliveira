### Hello there 👋

I am Fred Oliveira, a product-minded engineer, and currently the VP of Engineering at [Capital Factory](https://capitalfactory.com), a venture capital fund in Austin, Texas. Before Capital Factory, I consulted for [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com), built [Union](https://union.vc), was the Director of Engineering at [1776](https://1776.vc), and before _that_, I ran a product consultancy called [Webreakstuff](https://webreakstuff.com). A lifetime ago I was the first employee at [Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com) and co-wrote a book on Redis for O'Reilly. You can find me on [Twitter as @f](https://twitter.com/f).
