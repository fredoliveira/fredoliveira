### Hello there 👋

I am Fred Oliveira, a software engineer by trade, and currently the CTO at [Union](https://union.vc). Before Union, I was the Director of Engineering at [1776](https://1776.vc), and before _that_, I ran a product consultancy called [Webreakstuff](https://webreakstuff.com). A lifetime ago I was the first employee at [Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com). You can find me on [Twitter as @f](https://twitter.com/f).

<!--
- ⌨️ **Programming languages**: Ruby, Javascript, Swift, Obj-C. Some Rust, Go and Elixir. A bunch of C a lifetime ago.
- 🎹 **Music**: I used to produce music and helped run [a record label](https://discotexas.com), and a [netlabel](https://enoughrecords.org) before that.
- 👾 **Games**: I am a gamer, and have always toyed with the idea of working on a game too.
